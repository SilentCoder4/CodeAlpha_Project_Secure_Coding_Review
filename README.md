# CodeAlpha_Project_Secure_Coding_Review

The [CodeAlpha_Project_Basic_Network_Sniffer](https://github.com/SilentCoder4/CodeAlpha_Project_Basic_Network_Sniffer) is a Python-based project designed for cybersecurity training. It operates as a low-level network sniffer using raw sockets to capture and analyze network traffic. Below is a security review of its implementation based on the code reviewed from GitHub repositories and common best practices.

## Strengths:
1. Basic Error Handling:
    - Handles common exception like `permission` effectively.
    - Uses logging to a file for better debugging and post-capture analysis.

2. Use of Modular Functions:
    - Breaking down functionality into `sniff_packets` and `prc_packets` promotes modularity and reusability.

3. Output Sanitization:
    - Attempts to decode raw data with `error="ignore"` to handle malformed data without crashing.

## Identified Vulnerabilities and Recommendations:

1. Lack of Permissions Check
    - **Risk:** Packet sniffing generally requires administrative or root privileges. Running without them will result in a `PermissionError`.
    - **Fix**
        - Add a check to verify administrative privileges before starting:

```
        def check_permissions():
            if os.name == 'nt':
                return os.getuid() == 0
            print("Error: Please run as Administrator/root.")
```


2. Raw Packet Data Logging
    - **Risk:** Logging raw packet data to a file can inadvertently expose sensitive information like passwords or cookies if not handled securely.
    - **Fix:**
        - Encrypt sensitive logs using libraries like `cryptography` or restrict access to the log file:
```
os.chmod("sniffed_packets.txt", 0o600)  # File only accessible to the owner
```

3. Potential Memory Overflow
    - **Risk:** The script does not restrict the number or size of packets processed, potentially causing memory overflow in high-traffic environments.
    - **Fix:**
        - Use `count` or `timeout` arguments in `sniff()` to limit captured packets:
```
sniff(prn=prc_packets, iface=iface, store=False, count=100, timeout=60)
```

4. Missing Logging Sanitization
    - **Risk:** Directly writing raw data to logs can lead to log injection attacks or corrupt logs if malicious payloads contain control characters.
    - **Fix:**
        - Sanitize raw data before logging:
```
sanitized_data = raw_data.replace("\n", "\\n").replace("\r", "\\r")
```


5. No Security Boundary Enforcement
    - **Risk:** The script can be exploited by an attacker within the same network to sniff unwanted traffic.
    code harder to maintain.
    - **Fix:** 
        - Add filters to restrict sniffing to specific IP ranges or protocols:
```         
sniff(prn=prc_packets, iface=iface, store=False, filter="tcp and host 192.168.1.1/24") 
```

6. No Rate Limiting or Throttling
    - Risk: High packet capture rates can overwhelm the script.
    - Fix:
        - Throttle packet processing using a delay:
``` 
        import time
        time.sleep(0.01)
```

## Recommendations

1. Use Static Analysis Tools:
    - Run the code through tools like Bandit or PyLint to identify potential issues.

2. Document Responsibilities and Limitations:
    - Add clear comments or warnings about the scope and security concerns of the script.

3. Enhance Logging Security:
    - Encrypt sensitive data in logs using Python's cryptography library.

4. Code Hardening:
    - Limit resource usage and validate inputs robustly.
